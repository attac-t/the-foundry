# Skill: Craft Command

> "Thin commands. Fat skills."

## The Philosophy

Commands are **triggers**, not logic containers. If you're writing prose or instructions in a command body, **stop**. That belongs in a skill.

## The Spec

**Read first**: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands

## The Pattern

```markdown
---
description: One-line purpose.
argument-hint: <what user provides>
---

/skills/skill-name "$ARGUMENTS"
```
