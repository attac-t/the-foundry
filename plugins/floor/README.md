> Where work happens.

A **run** is one attempt at one work item. It lives outside every repository it will change.

---

## Why it sits outside

Working memory used to live in the repo being changed. That breaks three ways.

| Case | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Work spans two repos | Two memory folders, no shared record | One run, one record |
| The target is read-only | Nowhere to write | The run is not in the target |
| Two attempts, one branch name | They collide | Two runs, two ids |

---

## Use

```bash
sh bin/run.sh new "Ship the gift card flow"
sh bin/run.sh path
sh bin/run.sh home
```

`new` makes a run and points this checkout at it. `path` prints the active run, or exits 1.

**Making a run changes nothing in any repository.** Allowing that is a later gate.

---

## Where a run lives

```
${FOUNDRY_HOME:-$HOME/.foundry}/runs/<date>-<slug>-<short id>/
├── item.md            what someone wants
├── memory/            working.md, blueprint.md, spec.md, adr/
├── planning/          scratch space for planning
└── units/
    └── 01/
        └── memory/
```

The short id is the first free slot. It says nothing about the work, and exists only to stop two
runs from one title on one day landing in one directory.

**Slots are reused.** Delete a run and the next one with that date and title takes its number back,
so a pointer that outlived its run resolves to a different attempt. Harmless today, because nothing
keeps a pointer past the run it names. It stops being harmless in #72, when evidence starts citing a
run id — revisit the scheme there.

`units/` holds one unit today. The level is there from the first run because adding it later would
move every path in every adapter.

`planning/` is scratch space, and deliberately **not** called a workspace. Workspace is a seam in
RFC-001 with no written contract, this directory holds no checkout, and naming a thing after a
contract that does not exist is the mistake the word `seam` was added to stop. Planning must never
write to a target, and nothing enforces that yet because there are no targets until #68.

---

## Which run is active

```
FOUNDRY_RUN set?   → that run
a pointer here?    → the run it names
otherwise          → none, and `path` exits 1
```

The pointer lives in the git directory, so it is never committed and needs no gitignore entry. A
git worktree gets its own git directory, so it gets its own pointer.

**That is the whole answer to two runs at once.** Parallel runs are parallel worktrees. No lock
file, no scheduler.

---

## What kernel sees

kernel resolves memory from `FOUNDRY_RUN` and from nothing else:

```
FOUNDRY_RUN set?  → $FOUNDRY_RUN/memory
git branch?       → .claude/memory/<branch>     unchanged
otherwise         → .claude/memory              unchanged
```

One variable is the whole handshake. kernel never learns where floor keeps a run and never calls
floor, so each plugin still works with the other uninstalled.

**The cost is real.** A hook cannot export a variable into the session that started it. So a run
found through the pointer is a run kernel cannot see, and memory keeps resolving by branch. floor
says so at session start rather than letting you assume otherwise:

```bash
export FOUNDRY_RUN=$(sh bin/run.sh path)
```

---

## Install

Needs: Claude Code CLI, `sh`, `git`. No `awk`, no Python, no Node, no `jq`.

```
/plugin install floor@the-foundry
```

Standalone. Pairs with kernel, which is where the memory rung lives.

If it cannot run, it says so at the top of the next session. Silence means it is working.

---

## Where it runs

| Platform | Shell | Home |
|---|---|---|
| macOS, Linux | `sh` | `$HOME/.foundry` |
| Windows | the Git Bash Claude Code starts there | `$HOME/.foundry`, which Git Bash sets |

Git Bash and native Windows disagree about what a path looks like. That is a runtime concern, and
it stays one: **no file a run writes may hold a machine-local absolute path.** There is no
exception. The pointer holds a run id, not a path, and the home is an environment variable.

---

## Tests

```bash
bash tests/run.sh
```

Two suites, then twelve deliberate breaks that must each turn the suite red.

`model.sh` calls the runner. `install.sh` reads the command out of `hooks/hooks.json` and hands it
to a shell — because a suite that calls the scripts itself proves only that the scripts work, never
that the wiring does, which is where kernel and signal both failed.

*One attempt. One record.*
