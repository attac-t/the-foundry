# Skill: Craft ViewModel

> "View models have one job—providing correct data to views."

## The Standard

1. **Single Responsibility**: Transform data for views. No business logic.
2. **Implement Arrayable**: Public methods become view variables automatically.
3. **Optional Model**: Accept `?Model` in constructor. Null for create, instance for edit.
4. **Explicit Dependencies**: Inject User, Model—whatever the view needs.

## The Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't               | ✅ Do                          | Why                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| View Composers        | ViewModel in controller       | Explicit > implicit         |
| Duplicate create/edit | One ViewModel, optional model | DRY, single source of truth |
| Query in controller   | Query in ViewModel method     | Controller stays thin       |
| Return arrays         | Return ViewModel object       | Type safety, testability    |
