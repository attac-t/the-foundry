# Skill: Craft Spec

> "Specification work cannot be removed. Only moved."

Moved up front, into artifacts that outlive the session, it costs less than discovered in production.
Evans' aggregates, Meyer's contracts, Cockburn's ports — sequenced. **The order is the
contribution.**

## The Boundary

**This governs code that *decides*. It does not govern code that *depicts*.**

It applies wherever there is a decision spine — state that must not be corrupted, guarded by
transitions. That includes transactional domain logic **and state-machine UI**: a wizard is a state
machine wearing CSS.

It **idles** on projections — reports, transforms, rendering — where verification is golden examples
plus algebraic properties. It can host those; it cannot derive them. Read the boundary before you
start, not at step 9.

## Prerequisite

**Inside a convened panel, steps 4 and 10 may not be run by whoever did the work. No exception.**
Self-assessment of this kind runs near 29% accuracy, applied at the moment of maximum authorial
investment. `panel:adversary` judges gate 1; `panel:newcomer` judges gate 2.

**Walking this alone is a different thing, and legitimate** — the eleven steps are worth following
without a panel. There the gates degrade to self-checks: gate 1 by writing client code from three
callers, gate 2 cold after a deliberate gap. Record the weakening — `craft-charter`, *When Gates Are
Weakened*.

But a solo walk is **not a panel run**, and must not be recorded as one. Law 1 admits no degradation
inside a panel.

## The Walk

The numbering is the **order the artifacts depend on each other**, not an execution sequence.

**Blame assignment is why step 5 has four termini, not one.** A precondition violation is the
caller's bug, a postcondition the supplier's, an invariant the class's. Collapse them and a failing
contract is merely red instead of diagnostic. The fourth — a **constraint** enforced below the code,
a unique index or a serialisable transaction — is where concurrency properties live, and no draft
can show it.
