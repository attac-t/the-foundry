# Skill: Craft Expectation Chain

> "Chains compose. Nesting doesn't."

## The Standard

1. **One Subject, Many Assertions**: Chain assertions on the same value.
2. **`and()` for New Subjects**: Switch subjects explicitly.
3. **Break Nested Collections**: `->each->` allows ONE assertion. No deeper.

## The Anti-Patterns

| Don't                              | Do                    | Why              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| `->each->prop->each->`             | Separate expectations | Proxy limitation |
| Multiple `expect()` for same value | Chain assertions      | Fluency          |
| Implicit subject switches          | Use `->and()`         | Clarity          |
