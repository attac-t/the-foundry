# Skill: Craft Custom Expectation

> "Extract when patterns repeat."

## The Standard

1. **Rule of Three**: Extract when the same pattern appears 3+ times.
2. **Separate File**: Put all custom expectations in `tests/Expectations.php`.
3. **Return $this**: Always return `$this` to enable chaining.

## The Anti-Patterns

| Don't                 | Do                               | Why                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Extract single-use    | Keep inline                      | Clarity over abstraction |
| Forget `return $this` | Always return                    | Chaining breaks          |
| Scatter across files  | Centralize in `Expectations.php` | Discoverability          |
| Reinvent built-ins    | Use Pest's expectations          | Maintenance              |
