# Skill: Craft Job

> "Jobs are just another way of exposing business functionality to the outside world."

## The Standard

1. **Application Layer**: Jobs belong in App, not Domain. Like controllers.
2. **Delegate to Actions**: Business logic lives in Actions. Jobs orchestrate.
3. **Queue Configuration**: Jobs manage retries, delays, chaining—workflow, not logic.
4. **Prefer Queueable Actions**: For simple cases, skip the job class entirely.

## The Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't                     | ✅ Do                          | Why                     |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Business logic in `handle()` | Call `Action->execute()`       | Jobs aren't domain code |
| One job per action           | `Action::onQueue()->execute()` | Eliminates boilerplate  |
| Complex job chains           | Orchestrator action            | Testable, debuggable    |
| Domain namespace             | App\Jobs namespace             | Respects layer boundary |
