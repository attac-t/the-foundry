# Skill: Ground Suite

> "Never test the framework."

## The Standard

- **Domain Only**: Test your logic, not Laravel's. Eloquent works. Trust it.
- **Behavior Over Implementation**: Test what it does, not how it does it.
- **Zero Overlap**: Each test verifies one unique behavior.

## The Four Pillars

A good test has all four. Trade-offs exist between them.

| Pillar         | Question                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Protection** | Does it catch real bugs?     |
| **Resistance** | Does it survive refactoring? |
| **Speed**      | Does it run fast?            |
| **Clarity**    | Is it easy to understand?    |

Pillars 1 & 2 matter most. A test that breaks on refactoring is noise.

## The Check

Ask yourself:
- Would Nuno ship this test?
- Does this test my code or the framework?
- Will this test break if I refactor internals?
- If I add a new model, do I need a new test file?
